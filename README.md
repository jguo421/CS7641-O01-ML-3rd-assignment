## CS 7641 Assignment 3: Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction

This project is saved at https://github.com/jguo421/CS7641-O01-ML-3rd-assignment

2 cluster algorithms were studied: K-means and Expectation Maximization
4 dimensional reduction methods were tested
- PCA
- ICA
- Randomized Projection
- Isomap

sklearn library from jupter notebook is the tool for the machine learning models

2 dataset used:
- Apple quality, the same dataset used in assignment 1
- Blood test dataset downloaded from Kaggle.

The transformed data were applied to neural network model with 7/3 training/testing split.
